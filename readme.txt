== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. What do I need to do, to make the plugin work?
By default the plugin will redirect all 404s to the home page. If you want to redirect your 404s to a custom page, all you need to do is create a new page with the slug "axon". 
Important! You need to set the permalinks to post name, to get this feature to work.

2. Can do I customize to Axon page?
The page is like any other standard WordPress page, so any builder or custom content will work normally.

3. Will there be a control panel for the plugin?
Yes, the next version of the plugin will include a control panel from which you will be able to customize every aspect of the plugin.
